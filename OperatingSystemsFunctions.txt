Operating Systems Functions

System Start Up

One of the most important functions of an OS is to start up the computer.  When the power button is pressed the power supply sends a current to the circuitry.  This current resets the processor chips and as a result the firmware runs a POST.  This is a self-diagnostic that insures proper functionality in the hardware.  Upon verification that things are working properly the bootloader moves from storage to memory which loads the OS.  Next the kernel layer is moved to memory and performs a check on hardware communications.  The final step is for the application layer to take over which will load the UI where on most modern computers the user can login, activating their prefferred settings such as antivirus software.
